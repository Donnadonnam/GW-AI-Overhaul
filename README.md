# Galactic War AI Overhaul Readme

This mod works with both Planetary Annihilation and Planetary Annihilation Titans. It changes the following elements of Galactic War:

 - Restore faction personalities
   - Legonis Machina: land
   - Foundation: air/naval
   - Synchronous: balanced
   - Revenants: orbital
 - Customise each minion/sub-commander

   - Unique personality quirks
 - Five new difficulties

The boss personalities and those of their minions have not been changed.

## FAQ

### Does this mod work with the regular difficulty levels?
Some of the personality adjustments will work with the standard difficulties, but you should use the new difficulty levels to get the full effect.

### Can I use an AI mod like Queller?
Not at this time. Queller won't break this mod, it simply won't be used.

### How can I provide feedback?
Please use the mod's [forum thread](https://forums.planetaryannihilation.com/threads/client-galactic-war-ai-overhaul.72360/). I am especially interested in hearing feedback on the difficulty levels.

### Why don't the descriptions match up with the Commanders' names?
Because that would break the translations, so I've left them untouched.

### Will sub-commanders fighting for me have the same personality if I fight against them?
No, much of an enemy commander's personality is set by the difficulty level.

### Are all sub-commanders created equal?
No, some are objectively stupider than others.

### Is there a "fair" difficulty level?
No. I felt it was pointless to create a model where each battle is easier than the last.
