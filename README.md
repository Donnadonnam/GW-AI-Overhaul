## FAQ

#### Can I use an AI mod like Queller?
Not at this time. Queller won't break this mod, it simply won't be used.

#### How can I provide feedback?
Please use the mod's [forum thread](https://forums.planetaryannihilation.com/threads/client-galactic-war-ai-overhaul.72360/). I am especially interested in hearing feedback on the difficulty levels.

#### Why don't the descriptions match up with the Commanders' names?
Because that would break the translations, so I've left them untouched.

#### Will sub-commanders fighting for me have the same personality if I fight against them?
Yes. Mostly.

#### Are all sub-commanders created equal?
No, some are objectively stupider than others.

#### Is there a "fair" difficulty level?
No. I felt it was pointless to create a model where each battle is easier than the last.
