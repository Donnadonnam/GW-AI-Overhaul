## Planetary Intelligence

Each system will display the following information:

- **System Area**: the total surface size of all planets, excluding gas giants.

- **Threat Level**: based on the total eco score of all enemies.

- **Bounties**: gain an eco bonus for each army destroyed. Enemies gain these too.

- **Big Spawns**: you can land anywhere on any starting planet.

- **Team Death**: the defeat of a single army on a team leads to the defeat of the entire team. This includes Sub Commanders.

- **Threat**: the eco threat of that Commander. This increases the deeper you proceed into the galaxy.

- **Personality**: the playstyle adopted by the Commander. Some are better than others and it's up to you to figure out which.

## FAQ

**Q. Can I use an AI mod like Queller?**

No. Queller won't break this mod, it simply won't be used.

**Q. Will Sub Commanders fighting for me have the same personality if I fight against them?**

Yes. Mostly.

**Q. Are all Sub Commanders created equal?**

No, some are objectively stupider than others.

**Q. Is there a "fair" difficulty level?**

No. I felt it was pointless to create a model where each battle is easier than the last.

**Q. Why am I not seeing the latest changes in my war?**

Many changes will only apply to new wars.

**Q. Why am I seeing multiple Commanders for a single enemy army?**

Both bosses and FFA factions will use Shared Armies to allow for multiple Commanders within a single army. This provides them with more additional build power and more lives. In the case of bosses, it allows them to connect multiple planets very quickly.

**Q. Why aren't awarded bounties aren't showing on the player list?**

Galactic War hides eco modifies from the player list. The bounties are still being awarded. If you gain one it will show below your eco bar.

## Known Issues

1. Continue War does not continue the war if more than one enemy faction remains alive. Use Quit then Return to Galactic War to work around this.
2. Tougher Commanders can cause issues with certain personalities, in certain landing locations, when operating with very low eco rates.
