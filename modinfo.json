  "description": "Add some much needed variety and challenge to Galactic War. Includes a wide array of difficulty levels for all abilities, from someone who has only just completed the tutorial to the those with every loadout unlocked. Get intelligence reports for each system before you choose to fight. Fight in FFAs against more than one faction. Unique colours mean you can clearly identify who is who. Bosses offer a real challenge over surrounding systems. Each faction has its own style of play and each Commander its own personality. In larger galaxies the number of enemies will scale to provide you the epic battles you always wanted to have. For even more variety check out the mod 'Shared Systems for Galactic War', which works in conjunction with your maps and installed map packs to provide far more systems to fight in.",
