  "description": "Creates personality differences between the factions and each individual enemy Commander and friendly sub-commander. Legonis Machina focus on land, Foundation on air and naval, Revenants on orbital, Synchronous take a balanced approach. Sub-commanders are less able to carry the game for you. Overhauls the difficulty settings to provide more variety along with a much greater challenge at the higher settings. Uses the vanilla AI brain. Not compatible with other Galactic War mods which adjust difficulty.",
