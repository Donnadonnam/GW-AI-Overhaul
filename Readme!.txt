Nemuneko's Unique Commander Loadouts for Galactic War


-----Description-----
This mod adds 4 very unique commander loadouts with distinct playstyles. This is a first version which I created using 2 days, I tested it and it seems to work ok. I also tried to balance it a bit so that these loadouts are not too OP, but I have not played enough games to test it. Generally I feel the game is now easier, but thats just my thoughts. If there are other issues or suggestions, please send me a PM on the Uber forums. My ID on the forum is nemuneko. I hope you enjoy the new ways to mess up with the galaxy and destroy your enemies :D


-----Installation-----
1.Download Planetary Annihilation Mod Manager (PAMM)
2.Extract the rar and put the folder under C:\Users\Your account ID\AppData\Local\Uber Entertainment\Planetary Annihilation\client_mods
3.Run PAMM, this mod should appear under UI mods category, enable it
4.Run the game through PAMM


-----Change Log-----
2016/02/15	V1.0 	- Initial release.

2016/02/16	V1.01	- Corrected Readme.txt Nuke Launcher energy comparison mistake
			- Fixed area build separation, now turrets should build right next to each other when using area build command
			- Reset the number of neutral system to the default of 2
2016/02/18	V1.02	- Fixed an error which caused the game to freeze while trying to start with the Tactical Nuke Commander

2016/03/07	V1.03	- Fixed an error which caused the Adv Metal Extractor to cost 2000 times of the original (3M metal or something like that) instead of a flat 2000 metal


-----Loadout Details-----

Note: I will compare the attributes after modding with vanilla attributes like this: 'modded value(vanilla value)'

1. Planetary Excavation Commander
- Metal Extractors and Advanced Metal Extractors can now be placed anywhere with increased cost and decreased output. (Basic Metal Extractors: 4(7) output, 250(170) build cost; Advanced Metal Extractors: 15(24) output, 2000(1500) build cost.)
- Basic and Advanced Metal Extractors cannot be built on each other anymore. I would like to have them stack, but I can't figure out how :(
- Starts with basic vehicle tech.

Quite a conventional commander, with no paticular buffs or debuffs, should be the easiest one of all 4.


2. Space Excavation Commander
- Jigs can now be built everywhere with decreased cost and output.(30(36) metal output, 6250(9000) energy output, 750(3000) build cost.)
- Jig explosion deals 400(4000) damage. (1/10 of original. you won't get a chain reaction anymore, but it is still powerful enough to kill your fabbers.)
- Conventional resource buildings are not available.
- Commanders can build Orbital Launchers
- Orbital Fabrication Bots can build basic ground structures. (factories, defenses, storage and radars etc.)
- Starts with complete orbital tech, except that this commander cannot build Omegas. (orbital battleships)

I tried to make this commander a slow-starter with advanced orbital weaponry and enough resources in the middle stage of the game to mass produce them, but if you drag on for too long, without the HP of the Omega it could be quite hard to break through the enemy's planetary defenses. I am thinking about decreasing combat units' health to prevent rushes, let me know what you think after you have played it!


3. Defense Tech Commander
- Starts with advanced defenses. (Triple Barrel Laser Turrets, Flak Guns, Tactical Missiles, and Advanced Torpedo Launchers)
- Commander and basic fabber can build basic radar and all defensive structures including advanced ones.
- All laser turrets, anti-air defenses and torpedo launchers have their range increased by 50%, rate of fire increased by 25% and build cost decreased by 50%. They also receive a turret aim speed buff.
- Area build separation of laser turrets, anti-air defenses and torpedo launchers have been decreased by 50%
- Walls now have 100% more health, and 1/10 the build cost (5(50) metal to build and 4000(2000) HP)
- Starts with Fabrication Bots and Combat Fabrication Bots, nothing else. This means no mobile offensive units unless you have a tech.

I designed this to make defenses stronger and made them the only way of attacking in the early stages. Increased weapon range but not sight range means this commander will rely heavily on radars. I once buffed the range of tactical missile launchers but eventually decided to remove it, as it turns out to be quite OP. I personally attack with manually controlled missile launchers, but feel free to try out other playstyles. Beware, things could get quite ugly if you let your opponent live for too long.


4. Tactical Nuke Commander
- Replaces Nukes with a low-yield and low-cost variant, effectively altering its purpose.
- Nuke Launchers can now be built by basic fabbers.
- Nukes now deal 750(33000) splash and normal damage, requires 300(50000) metal to build, splash radius/full damage splash radius decreased to 50(150) and 45(125)
- Nuke Launcher build cost decreased to 2500(14400), they now consume 15(120) metal and 2250(12000) energy when building nukes.
- Removed the blueprints for Double&Triple Barrel Laser Turrets, Flak Guns, Tactical Missile Launchers, Advanced Torpedo Launchers and Anchors.
- Starts with Fabrication Vehicles and light tanks.

The name could be quite tempting, but I think this commander could be quite difficult to play. The lack of defenses means it might need to fire nukes to stop incoming enemies (which is something that I want to see), and probably more than one of them will be needed. I added light tanks to make defending metal spots easier, but it should not be too easy. A high initial cost and the following demand of energy could make you take longer to effectively take down bases, but as I said I did not test these loadouts thoroughly, these are just my playthrough's first impressions. Nukes does have the advantage of being hard to intercept though, so try it out and tell me what you think!


-----Known Issues-----
- Sub commanders tend to not function with certain loadouts that tweak metal extractors.
- Increased range of defensive structures can sometimes lead to their projectiles being blocked by terrain. (Laser Turrets in paticular)
- I did not mod the vanilla decks, so techs that are effectively repetitive could probably come up, i.e. Defense commander getting the advanced defenses tech, and space excavation commander getting the complete orbital tech, and so on.
- Disabling the mod results in two empty commander slots in loadout selection screen, I probably made a mistake somewhere, but I don't know how to solve it yet.


-----Mod Compatibility-----
This mod tackles gw_dealer.js and gw_start.js, so deck mods and loadout mods would be affected.


-----Redistribution-----
Feel free to send this mod to anyone or modify the files as you like, but please include this file and my name (nemuneko, or steam ID:ItsukaKotori_) as the original author.


-----Special Thanks-----
Special thanks to wondible on the Uber forum, he gave me very important advices, without him I wouldn't be able to finish this mod.

-----指挥官配置细节-----

注：数据比较使用以下格式 “更改后数据（原版数据）”

1. 行星开发指挥官 Planetary Excavation Commander
- 金属提炼塔及高级金属提炼塔可在任何地方建造，造价上升，产能下降。 (基础金属提炼塔： 4(7) 产出， 250(170) 造价；高级金属提炼塔： 15(24) 产出， 2000(1500) 造价)
- 基础和高级金属提炼塔现在无法堆叠

- 以完全轨道科技开局，但无法建造轨道战列舰。


3. 防御科技指挥官 Defense Tech Commander
- 开局即拥有高级防御设施（三管激光炮塔、对空高射炮塔、战术导弹发射井以及高级鱼雷发射器）
- 指挥官及基础工程单位可建造基础雷达及所有防御设施（包括高级）
- 所有激光炮台、防空炮塔及鱼雷发射器射程增加50%，射速增加25%，造价减少50%，炮塔瞄准速度也有提升。

-----已知问题-----
- 在一些调整了金属提炼塔的配置中副指挥官会无法建造金属提炼塔，进而引发一些问题
- 防御设施射程增加后直射弹药有可能被地形挡住
- 类似于防御科技指挥官拿到高级防御科技的情形可能会出现
- 不使用mod时选择银河战争会出现2个空指挥官栏位


-----Mod兼容性-----
本mod修改了gw_start.js以及gw_dealer.js，因此其他银河战争配置或银河战争卡组mod将与本mod冲突。

-----鸣谢-----
感谢Uber官方论坛上的wondible，他给了我很多帮助，没有他这个mod根本不会出现。虽然我估计他看不懂中文，但是还是感谢！
